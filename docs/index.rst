Welcome to Good Tables's documentation!
=============================================

Good Tables is a python library and command line tool for validating and transforming tabular data.

**Tabular data** in the form of CSV or Excel is passed through a pipeline of **processors**. These processors can **check structure**, for example are their blank rows or columns, do rows have the same length as the header etc, and they can also **validate against a schema**, for example does the data have the expected columns, is the data of the right type (are dates actually dates).

Optionally, the data source is **transformed** as it passes through the pipeline.

In return, the client receives a **report** on processing performed and, optionally, the output data.

Design goals
============

High-level design goals for Good Tables:

* Process tabular data in CSV, Excel and JSON formats
* Provide a suite of small tools that each implement a type of processing to run
* Provide a pipeline API for registering built-in and custom processors
* Components should be easily usable in 3rd party (Python) code
